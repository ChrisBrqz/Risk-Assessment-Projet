# Risk-Assessment-Projet
Botium Toys Audit

This project simulates a full-scale cybersecurity audit and risk assessment of a fictional company, Botium Toys. It includes asset identification, control evaluations, compliance analysis, and risk scoring â€” all based on industry frameworks such as NIST CSF, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

Project Contents
- **Audit Overview:** Defines scope, goals, and key systems/assets under review  
- **Asset Inventory:** Hardware, software, network, and physical infrastructure
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluation of gaps in security controls and their impact  
- **Controls Checklist:** Comparison of current practices vs. best practices  
- **Compliance Review:** PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 1/2 alignment  
- **Recommendations:** Specific, actionable security improvements

Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Risk scoring (scale 1â€“10)
- Asset classification
- Control deficiencies (e.g., lack of least privilege, encryption, disaster recovery)
- Framework alignment:
  - NIST Cybersecurity Framework
  - PCI DSS
  - GDPR
  - SOC 1 / SOC 2 Controls


Notable Findings
- ðŸ”´ Lack of encryption for credit card data  
- ðŸ”´ No intrusion detection system (IDS)  
- ðŸ”´ Missing disaster recovery plans  
- ðŸŸ¡ Password policy exists but lacks complexity requirements  
- ðŸŸ¢ Antivirus, firewalls, and physical security measures are in place

Final Recommendations
- Enforce least privilege & separation of duties  
- Develop disaster recovery plans & backup policies  
- Encrypt sensitive customer data  
- Centralize and enforce password management  
- Fully classify and track assets across the organization

Summary
This report showcases the full risk assessment lifecycle: from asset discovery to gap analysis and final security recommendations. It demonstrates my ability to perform technical audits, align with cybersecurity frameworks, and deliver actionable security improvements for enterprise environments.
